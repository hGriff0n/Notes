Button
Content Control
Menu
ScrollBar
Rectangle
ScrollViewer
StackPanel
Seperator

Have to attach the slider to 3 of the 4 sides in order to get correct resizing behavior
  This also applies with the menu bar at the top
The slider is wildly off kilter to notepads
  Slider control is tiny (no text yet)
Menu bar is grey, not white
  Menu Items aren't restricted to the app
  Have to double click on form to generate callback methods
Commands

  Adding Custom Commands is way to difficult
	Create static class to hold commands
	Create static instances of RoutedUICommand
	  Add in correct getters
	Then access the command using "{namespace}:{class}:command" in xaml
