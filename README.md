The purpose of this project is to build a better notes program for my personal use

Design Goals:
The created notepad substitue should:
    1) Maintain a similar UI to notepad
    2) Maintain a similar feature list to notepad
    3) Maintain similar performance to notepad
    3) Add in better Ctrl-Z/Ctrl-Y support
    4) Treat \n correctly on windows
    5) Not have a tab issue when converting with mkpost.rb

Need to determine what language to use:
    C++ with CMake and Clang
    C#
    Rust
    Scala
