The purpose of this project is to build a better notes program for my personal use

Design Goals:
The created application (Notes) should:

    1) Maintain a similar UI, feature list, and performance to notepad
        a) ie. Don't regress from notepad
    2) Add in better Ctrl-Z/Ctrl-Y support
    3) Treat \n correctly on windows
    4) Not have a tab issue when converting with mkpost.rb

Some optional ideas:
	1) Support textmate colorization (ala VS Code)
